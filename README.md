## Description
My final project is a game called Escape the Maze. It is a maze game where the player is trying to escape the maze that is their house, and I created it with the help of some tutorials. It includes many original images that I made myself, as well as files from the internet in order to create the look that I wanted the game to have.

(second paragraph = what files my repository contains and why)
My repository contains my proposal, the README file (*this*), my requirements text file, my python file, and my game images. 

(third paragraph = functions I made and how they work maybe...)


(fourth paragraph = design considerations)


(fifth paragraph = future areas of improvement)
Some areas for future improvement are that I could probably add obstacles to make the maze more difficult. It was something that I included in my proposal that I didn't end up getting to, and was too ambitious for. If I had more time I would draw the obstacles in and add them as a list so that I could blit an obstacle onto the screen. I would then make it so the obstacle could fade in and out, almost like the digital rain.
