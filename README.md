## Description
My final project is a game called Escape the Maze. It is a maze game where the player is trying to escape the maze that is their house and it has been booby trapped by their mother so that the player stays. I created it with the help of some tutorials. It includes many original images that I made myself, as well as files from the internet in order to create the look that I wanted the game to have.

My repository contains my proposal, my README file, my requirements text file, and my source folder (src). My proposal contains my final project proposal and what I was hoping to accomplish with this project. This is my README file and it contains a description of my project so that anyone who wants to know what the program does can read the file and understand. My requirements text file contains all the libraries/packages that the program I created needs in order to run. Within my src folder is my python file, which contains my program, and my game images folder. My game images folder contains all of the images that I used within my game to make it more customized and to my liking. Most of the images are things I drew myself, with the only exception being the wood floor image.

Design considerations that I had for this project were that I wanted the game to look unique while also having the mechanics of a maze game. I wanted to use my own drawings and make distinct design choices to set it apart from other maze games. I also wasn't entirely sure how I wanted the maze to look at first, but I'm glad I decided on the look that I chose because it looks cozy. However, a house can look cozy without being a home, and that is an important part of my game's story, which is that the player is trying to escape the maze that his mother set up. That is who is included in both the win and lose screens because his mother is the reason that the player is trying to escape. I decided to include a timer in my game because I thought that it would make the game harder, and I was shown how to accomplish it in one of the tutorials I used. It also adds a stronger sense of urgency to complete the game and escape. 

Some areas for future improvement are that I could probably add more obstacles to make the maze more difficult. It was something that I included in my proposal that I didn't end up fleshing out to the full extent that I intended. If I had more time I would create more obstacles, then add them to my repository through my game images folder. I would then add them as a list in my program so that I could blit any random obstacle onto the screen, and then the obstacle could fade in and out at random moments.
