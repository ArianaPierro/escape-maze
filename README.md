## Description
(first paragraph = summary of project) 
My final project is a game called Escape the Maze. It is a maze game where the player is trying to escape the maze that is their house, and I created it with the help of some tutorials. It includes many original images that I made myself, as well as files from the internet in order to create the look that I wanted the game to have.
