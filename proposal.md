# Escape the Maze

## Repository
https://github.com/ArianaPierro/escape-maze.git

## Description
A game where you have to escape randomly generated mazes until you get caught or get stumped. 

## Features
- Original Designs
	- I plan to blit in the designs in what will most likely be a game object so that they can be used in the game.
- Maze Walls
    - I plan to have there by walls that the player can't pass through so that they have to figure out the maze.
- Player
    - I plan to include the player as a blited in game object that the player can manipulate.
- Obstacles
	- I plan to include obstacles in the same way with the walls except that game ends when you hit the obstacles.

## Challenges
- I will need to research how to create obstacles in a pygame game and how to restrict them to the maze walls.
- I will need to learn how to create the maze so that the player has to go to the exit.
- I will need to learn how to implement mouse input so that can press buttons in game for when to start, go to next level, and restart.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I make a game that creates a random maze with obstacles that I designed and maybe drew myself. I also hope to include original characters created by me.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- I make a maze game that I customized to be my own.
